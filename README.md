# Mockup Design Report
# A subtle design with muted colours was used to highlight the displayed image. The date field is positioned in the centre for immediate visibility upon the user's initial visit. Below the date field, a section was added to showcase the user's favourite images, considering those who revisit the site for their favourites rather than new ones. Additionally, the add-to-favourites icon was placed at the top right of the image on the APOD page (bottom for mobile) for user convenience and intuitiveness.

# Prototype Design Report
# Recreating my designed mockup turned out to be more time-consuming than I expected because of the meticulous positioning and styling of each element. Fortunately, I faced no major challenges as the reference I had to refer to was clear.

# Final Design Report
# The project started with a mobile-first webpage using HTML and responsive CSS. JavaScript is used for fetching APOD data from NASA's APOD API, dynamically updating the content. Challenges included ensuring dynamic content updates, optimising JavaScript, and handling JavaScript fucntions, especially with fetching data from the API.
