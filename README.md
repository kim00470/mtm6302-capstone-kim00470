# Mockup Design Report
# A subtle design with muted colours was used to highlight the displayed image. The date field is positioned in the centre for immediate visibility upon the user's initial visit. Below the date field, a section was added to showcase the user's favourite images, considering those who revisit the site for their favourites rather than new ones. Additionally, the add-to-favourites icon was placed at the top right of the image on the APOD page (bottom for mobile) for user convenience and intuitiveness.
